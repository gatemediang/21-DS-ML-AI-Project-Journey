# Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of Airline Passengers

## 1. Problem Statement

This project addresses the problem of analyzing and forecasting the number of airline passengers over time. The goal is to build a time series model that can accurately predict future passenger numbers, taking into account historical trends and seasonal patterns. The dataset exhibits a clear upward trend and strong annual seasonality, which are key challenges to address in the modeling process.

## 2. Solution Offered

The solution involves a comprehensive time series analysis workflow, including:
- Data loading and initial visualization.
- Decomposition of the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components to understand underlying patterns.
- Testing for stationarity using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, a crucial step for many time series models.
- Applying transformations (log transformation and differencing) to make the series stationary.
- Identifying potential model parameters using Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) plots.
- Building and evaluating time series models, specifically focusing on ARIMA and SARIMA, to capture both non-seasonal and seasonal patterns.
- Comparing the performance of different smoothing methods (Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing) with the SARIMA model.
- Forecasting future passenger numbers and evaluating the model's accuracy using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

The SARIMA model is presented as the primary solution due to its ability to effectively model both trend and seasonality in the data, leading to a better fit and more accurate forecasts compared to simpler methods like ARIMA or exponential smoothing for this dataset.

## 3. Libraries and Visualizations Used and Why

The following Python libraries were used:

- **pandas:** For data manipulation and time series indexing. It provides efficient data structures like DataFrames and Series, essential for handling time series data.
- **numpy:** For numerical operations, particularly for applying the log transformation.
- **matplotlib.pyplot & seaborn:** For creating visualizations. Plots are critical in time series analysis for:
    - Visualizing the original time series to identify trends, seasonality, and other patterns.
    - Plotting decomposed components (trend, seasonality, residuals) to understand their individual contributions.
    - Displaying ACF and PACF plots to help determine ARIMA/SARIMA model parameters.
    - Visualizing model fits and forecasts against actual data for evaluation.
    - Comparing the performance of different models.
- **statsmodels:** This is the core library for time series analysis and modeling. It provides:
    - `sm.tsa.seasonal_decompose`: For decomposing the time series.
    - `adfuller` from `statsmodels.tsa.stattools`: For performing the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test of stationarity.
    - `plot_acf`, `plot_pacf` from `statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots`: For generating autocorrelation plots used in model identification.
    - `ARIMA`, `SARIMAX` from `statsmodels.tsa.arima.model` and `statsmodels.tsa.statespace`: For building the ARIMA and SARIMA models.
    - `SimpleExpSmoothing`, `ExponentialSmoothing` from `statsmodels.tsa.holtwinters`: For implementing exponential smoothing methods.
- **sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error:** To calculate the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for model evaluation.

Visualizations are used extensively throughout the notebook to provide intuitive insights into the data characteristics, the effects of transformations, and the performance of the models.

## 4. Summary of Key Insights

- The airline passenger data exhibits a strong upward trend and clear annual seasonality with increasing variance over time.
- The initial time series is non-stationary, as confirmed by the high p-value from the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test.
- Log transformation stabilized the variance, and applying both non-seasonal and seasonal differencing successfully made the time series stationary (p-value < 0.05).
- ACF and PACF plots on the differenced data helped in identifying potential orders for the non-seasonal ARIMA parameters (p=1, q=1).
- A simple ARIMA(1,1,1) model captures the trend but fails to capture the seasonality.
- The SARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,1,12) model significantly improves forecasting accuracy by explicitly modeling the seasonal component, closely following the actual passenger numbers in the test period.
- Compared to simpler methods like Moving Averages and Double Exponential Smoothing, the SARIMA model provides a much better fit for this dataset, highlighting the importance of accounting for seasonality in time series forecasting.
- The RMSE of the SARIMA model indicates the average magnitude of the errors in the forecasts.

## 5. Procedure on How to Use This Code

1.  **Environment Setup:** Ensure you have Python installed with the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`, `sklearn`). If running in Google Colab, these are largely pre-installed, but the notebook includes a `pip install statsmodels` command to ensure it's available.
2.  **Clone the Dataset:** Run the `!git clone` command in the notebook to download the dataset used in the project.
3.  **Run Cells Sequentially:** Execute the code cells in the notebook from top to bottom. Each cell performs a specific step in the time series analysis and modeling process.
4.  **Inspect Outputs:** Review the output of each cell, including plots and printed statistics (like ADF test results), to understand the data and the model building process.
5.  **Modify and Experiment:** The code provides a baseline. Users can experiment with:
    - Different transformation techniques.
    - Different orders (p, d, q) and seasonal orders (P, D, Q, m) for the ARIMA and SARIMA models.
    - Different train/test splits.
    - Incorporating external factors (exogenous variables) if available, which would require using `SARIMAX`.
6.  **Interpret Results:** Analyze the final forecast plot and RMSE to evaluate the performance of the chosen model.
