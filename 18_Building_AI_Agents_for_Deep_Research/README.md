# AI Agent for Deep Research

## 1. Problem

Conducting thorough and up-to-date research on rapidly evolving fields, such as Artificial Intelligence, can be time-consuming and require sifting through vast amounts of information. Synthesizing these findings into a clear and concise format, like a blog post, also demands specific writing skills and an understanding of the target audience.

## 2. Solution Offered

This project demonstrates the use of AI agents, powered by CrewAI, to automate the process of researching the latest AI industry trends and generating a blog post based on the findings. By defining specialized agents with distinct roles (Market Researcher and Content Writer) and tasks, the workflow streamlines information gathering, analysis, and content creation. The integration of a search tool allows the agents to access real-time information from the internet, ensuring the research is current.

## 3. All Libraries Used and Why

*   **`crewai`**: This library is used to orchestrate the interaction between different AI agents. It provides the framework for defining agents, tasks, and crews to build autonomous workflows.
*   **`crewai-tools`**: This library provides pre-built tools that agents can use to interact with the external world. In this project, the `SerperDevTool` is used to enable the Market Researcher agent to perform internet searches.
*   **`langchain-google-genai`**: This library provides the interface to use Google's Generative AI models (like Gemini) as the underlying Large Language Model (LLM) for the agents.
*   **`google.colab.userdata`**: This module is used specifically within Google Colab to securely access API keys stored in the Colab secrets manager.
*   **`os`**: This built-in Python module is used to interact with the operating system, specifically to set environment variables like the API key for the search tool.

## 4. How Anyone Can Implement This Code Locally

To run this code locally, you will need:

*   **Python 3.9 or higher**
*   **Access to Google Gemini API**: Obtain an API key from Google AI Studio.
*   **Access to Serper API**: Obtain an API key from Serper.dev.
*   **Install necessary libraries**:
